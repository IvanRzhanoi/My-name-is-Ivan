The app has been written in Swift with API in Objective-c, which is provided by \"Interaxon Inc.\", the creators of brainsensing headband\n\n\n\nIt took half a year of development time with most of the it being dedicated towards fixing bugs. The app is not yet published due to licecnsing issues with the company providing the API for the equipment\n\n\nFor more information on project please check\n\nhttp://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:amk-2018060512587")
        let project2 = Project(name: "Optimov", image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "Optimov"), description: "An online-based service that helps patients rehabilitate\n\nOptimov is a start-up, which offers a variety of services related to healthcare, mostly physiotherapy. It is going to be steadily integrated in hospitals to ease doctors’ work. Doctor will be able to assign their patients some training and track their health as well as general performance\n\nI was responsible for the free iOS version of an app, which is being used for demonstrative purposes as of writing. It was made with Swift and embedded Unity. Unity part was already made for Android. I also had to alter some C# code on Unity script. The greatest challenge was to make Unity load with the corresponding ViewController as it automatically loads with the whole application\n\nI also made some script to make server calls and update the user's infromation using JSON and Core Data. The app has a questionnaire section, to which the patient has to answer. The code picks exercises based on patient's performance, it then assembles the JSON string and sends it to Unity part, which plays the exercises. On top of that, I have found and fixed a few issues within the PHP code on the server side. Finally, I managed the beta version through iTunes Connect\n\nFor more information on project please check\n\nhttps://optimov.com")
